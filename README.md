# Evolutionary Genomics of Plumage Polymorphism in Common and Oriental Cuckoos

This project aims to investigate the evolutionary genomics behind plumage polymorphism in Rufous and Grey Common and Oriental Cuckoos.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **pca**: Principal component analyses files and results.

- **final_figures**: Finalized figures for the manuscript or presentations.

- **divergence_dating**: Files and results related to the estimation of divergence dates.

- **divergence**: Files and results related to general divergence analyses.

- **trees**: Phylogenetic trees and related data files and analysis scripts.

- **admixture**: Admixture analysis files and results.

- **EntireMetadata.txt**: Metadata for all samples used in this project.

- **vcfs**: Variant Call Format (VCF) files used in various analyses.

- **general**: General scripts, data, and other files not categorized elsewhere.

- **bsp**: Files and results related to Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) analyses.
